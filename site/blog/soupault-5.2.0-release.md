<p id="post-excerpt">
Soupault 5.2.0 is available for download from <a href="https://files.baturin.org/software/soupault/5.2.0">my own server</a>
and from <a href="https://github.com/PataphysicalSociety/soupault/releases/tag/5.2.0">GitHub releases</a>.
It is a small release with one new Lua plugin function and an important bug fix.
</p>

## New features

### New Lua API functions

* `Sys.strip_extension(str)` for stripping only the last extension
  from a file name.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed a regression that caused errors when saving
  pages generated by index processors
  (GitHub issue #85, discovery by Yiming Xiang).
* Fixed incorrect formatting of the log message
  for plugins that are missing file/lua_source options.
